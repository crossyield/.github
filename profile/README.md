## 🤔What is Crossyield🤔?
Crossyield is a DeFi protocol that utilizes Circle's CCTP and Account Abstraction to perform gas-less, cross-chain collateralization of assets for self-repaying loans.
## Product Description
### ‼️Problem Statement‼️
This innovative project aims to tackle a few major problems that are being faced in the Defi space,
1. Poor management of debt leads to bigger problems
2. Currently, borrowing & Lending platforms do not support cross-chain collateralization
3. Bridging of assets requires high gas fees
### 🌟Vision🌟
CrossYield aims to allow users to have the flexibility to borrow/ lend loans across different chains without the need for bridging and incurring any additional gas fees. Borrowed loans can be repaid using the yield generated by the asset collateral. 
### 🪄Unique Value Proposition🪄
CrossYield makes it easy for people like you and John to borrow loans on a decentralized platform with support for gasless, cross-chain collateralization of assets for self-repaying loans. Users can easily borrow loans from our platform even though their assets are collateralized on different chains.
